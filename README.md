# üõ°Ô∏è SOC Homelab ‚Äî Windows AD, Splunk, Sysmon, Kali & FortiGate (End-to-End Implementation with MITRE ATT&CK)

## üìå Project Overview

This project is all about building a hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) homelab where I simulate real-world attacks, collect logs, and analyze them inside Splunk.

The idea was to replicate a mini-enterprise environment:

I set up:  
- **Windows Server 2022** (Active Directory Domain Controller)  
- **Windows 10 workstation** (joined to the domain)  
- **Splunk Enterprise on Ubuntu** (SIEM)  
- **Sysmon + Universal Forwarder** on endpoints for telemetry  
- **FortiGate Firewall** forwarding logs to Splunk  
- **Kali Linux attacker** generating brute-force & MITRE ATT&CK simulation attacks  
The result: a hands-on lab showing how to detect and investigate brute-force attacks end-to-end.

The **goal** was to:  
- Detect brute-force authentication attempts  
- Capture process and endpoint telemetry with Sysmon  
- Collect firewall traffic logs (FortiGate)  
- Simulate adversary behaviors using **Atomic Red Team**  
- Build Splunk **dashboards + alerts** for detection and investigation

üëâ By the end, I had a fully working SOC lab that detects failed logons, successful brute force, suspicious processes, and firewall activity.

## üöÄ Architecture
### Components
- üñ• **Kali Linux (Attacker)** ‚Üí brute force with Hydra, run adversary simulations.  
- üî• **FortiGate Firewall** ‚Üí edge firewall, forwards logs (syslog UDP/514) to Splunk.  
- üè∞ **Active Directory DC (WIN-DC01)** ‚Üí authenticates domain logons, generates Windows Security events.  
- üíª **Windows 10 Workstation** ‚Üí target machine, running Sysmon + Splunk UF.  
- üìä **Splunk Enterprise Server (Ubuntu)** ‚Üí SIEM, log collection, dashboards, and alerts.

### Data Flow
- Attacker (Kali) ‚Üí Target/DC (brute force, PowerShell, process creation)  
- Target + DC ‚Üí Splunk (Windows Security + Sysmon logs via UF)  
- FortiGate ‚Üí Splunk (network logs via syslog)  
- Splunk ‚Üí Security Analyst (dashboards, alerts, investigation)

## üåê Hyper-V Networking Notes
- Used a **NAT/bridged vSwitch (LabNAT)** for VM-to-VM + internet connectivity.  
- Could also isolate traffic with multiple vSwitches + routing rules.  
- Best practice: **create checkpoints** before major changes.  
- **Dynamic disks** used (expandable VHDX). Expanded Ubuntu LVM when Splunk disk filled up.  
- **Enhanced session mode** enabled for clipboard/file sharing.

## üì• Splunk Universal Forwarder (Windows + Sysmon)
### Why UF?
The **Universal Forwarder** is a lightweight Splunk agent. It:  
- Forwards Windows Security logs + Sysmon logs to Splunk.  
- Keeps Splunk server lean by offloading collection to endpoints.

![Nat_Created](https://github.com/victormbogu1/Windows-Brute-Force-Detection-Monitoring-with-Splunk-Sysmon-and-FortiGate/blob/261569f373dec8813673ea83d429ca1bd678b3ab/New%20folder%20(3)/Splunk%20forward%20events.png)

## üêâ Attacker Simulation with Kali (Hydra)
### Why Hydra?
Hydra is a fast password-cracking tool. In this lab:  
- Simulated **RDP brute force** against the target.  
- Generated **Event ID 4625** (failed logons) and **4624** (successful logons).

### Example Command:

- hydra -l Administrator -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt rdp://192.168.10.40 -t 4 -W 1

![Nat_Created](https://github.com/victormbogu1/Windows-Brute-Force-Detection-Monitoring-with-Splunk-Sysmon-and-FortiGate/blob/261569f373dec8813673ea83d429ca1bd678b3ab/New%20folder%20(3)/Hydra%20to%20attack.png)

## Perform failed and successful logon attempts on the monitored hosts to verify which events are generated, allowing you to analyze how Splunk captures, identifies, and logs these security-relevant activities.

![Nat_Created](https://github.com/victormbogu1/Windows-Brute-Force-Detection-Monitoring-with-Splunk-Sysmon-and-FortiGate/blob/a17912a36a48903868eff50066db41e724c56239/New%20folder%20(4)/Count%20by%20Event_Host.png)

## Splunk detected event code 4625 from the attacker machine, corresponding to failed login attempts originating from IP 192.168.10.50. The events are logged over time, reflecting multiple unsuccessful login attempts as part of the attack simulation.

![Nat_Created](https://github.com/victormbogu1/Windows-Brute-Force-Detection-Monitoring-with-Splunk-Sysmon-and-FortiGate/blob/261569f373dec8813673ea83d429ca1bd678b3ab/New%20folder%20(3)/Attacker%20failed%204625.png)

## Splunk captured event code 4624 from the attacker machine, signifying a successful logon to the Target Machine. This confirms that the attack simulation achieved a successful login, as reflected in the event logs.

![Nat_Created](https://github.com/victormbogu1/Windows-Brute-Force-Detection-Monitoring-with-Splunk-Sysmon-and-FortiGate/blob/261569f373dec8813673ea83d429ca1bd678b3ab/New%20folder%20(3)/Successful%20logon%20by%20the%20attacker.png)

## A table was generated in Splunk highlighting the high-rate brute force attacks from the Kali attacker machine (IP: 192.168.100.50), providing a clear view of the frequency and volume of login attempts recorded during the simulation.

# üß™ Atomic Red Team (MITRE ATT&CK Simulation)

### üìå Why Atomic Red Team?
Atomic Red Team (ART) is an **open-source project** that provides lightweight tests mapped directly to the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**.  
Instead of running a real attacker toolkit, ART lets us **safely simulate adversary techniques** and validate whether our detection pipeline (Sysmon ‚Üí UF ‚Üí Splunk) catches them.

This was a crucial part of the lab because:
- It validated that **Windows Security Events + Sysmon telemetry** were being forwarded correctly.
- It proved Splunk could **detect & map adversary behavior** in line with ATT&CK techniques.
- It helped practice **incident triage**: which logs appear, how to search, how to visualize.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
1. On **Target-PC**, created a folder `C:\AtomicRedTeam`.
2. Excluded the folder from **Microsoft Defender AV** (‚ö†Ô∏è only for lab purposes).
3. Allowed PowerShell scripts to run:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser

## Created a folder named ‚ÄòAtomic‚Äô in the C: drive

![Nat_Created](https://github.com/victormbogu1/Windows-Brute-Force-Detection-Monitoring-with-Splunk-Sysmon-and-FortiGate/blob/e88c710edcb2a30cd86d7a37a3821bff3a40df40/New%20folder%20(3)/AtomicRed%20local%20folder.png)

## Configured Windows Defender to exclude the folder C:\AtomicRedTeam from real-time scanning.

![Nat_Created](https://github.com/victormbogu1/Windows-Brute-Force-Detection-Monitoring-with-Splunk-Sysmon-and-FortiGate/blob/5ee5fdbebae56a714ad29efd5deaeedc17656481/New%20folder%20(4)/Screenshot%202025-08-29%20093808.png)

## Configured the environment to simulate attacks using Atomic Red Team, forward logs to Splunk, and analyze them similarly to SOC operations. Enabled PowerShell script execution and ran the GitHub script to clone the Atomic Red Team repository directly into the C:\Atomic folder.

![Nat_Created](https://github.com/victormbogu1/Windows-Brute-Force-Detection-Monitoring-with-Splunk-Sysmon-and-FortiGate/blob/1b97def7e0f6bdd1aad7d86d56951dd3599491df/New%20folder%20(3)/Git%20Clone.png)

## All tests available in Atomic Red Team are now accessible, with each test named according to the corresponding MITRE ATT&CK technique. For example, the T1136.001 test corresponds to the ‚ÄòCreate Account: Local Account‚Äô persistence technique. The test was executed as Administrator on the Target_PC. Splunk Forwarder automatically captures these events and forwards them to the Splunk server. The following Windows Security events are generated:

![Nat_Created](https://github.com/victormbogu1/Windows-Brute-Force-Detection-Monitoring-with-Splunk-Sysmon-and-FortiGate/blob/e88c710edcb2a30cd86d7a37a3821bff3a40df40/New%20folder%20(3)/Atomicred.png)

## ‚ÄúCreated two new local user accounts: Newlocaluser and Crowr~

![Nat_Created](https://github.com/victormbogu1/Windows-Brute-Force-Detection-Monitoring-with-Splunk-Sysmon-and-FortiGate/blob/1b97def7e0f6bdd1aad7d86d56951dd3599491df/New%20folder%20(3)/New%20local%20user%20created.png)

## Deleted the local user Newlocaluser on the Target_PC to simulate and test the T1136.001 MITRE ATT&CK technique, which involves creating a local account for persistence. Splunk Forwarder is expected to capture the corresponding events:

![Nat_Created](https://github.com/victormbogu1/Windows-Brute-Force-Detection-Monitoring-with-Splunk-Sysmon-and-FortiGate/blob/1b97def7e0f6bdd1aad7d86d56951dd3599491df/New%20folder%20(3)/remove%20local%20user.png)

## Splunk captured and displayed the creation of the Newlocaluser account on the client machine:

![Nat_Created](https://github.com/victormbogu1/Windows-Brute-Force-Detection-Monitoring-with-Splunk-Sysmon-and-FortiGate/blob/1b97def7e0f6bdd1aad7d86d56951dd3599491df/New%20folder%20(3)/Newlocaluser%20MATT.png)

## The Splunk server successfully received and indexed the event indicating that the Crowr account was created on the client machine, demonstrating that the Splunk Forwarder is accurately capturing multiple account creation activities.

![Nat_Created](https://github.com/victormbogu1/Windows-Brute-Force-Detection-Monitoring-with-Splunk-Sysmon-and-FortiGate/blob/1b97def7e0f6bdd1aad7d86d56951dd3599491df/New%20folder%20(3)/Coweruser.png)

## During the Atomic Red Team simulations, various Windows Security event codes were generated, reflecting different activities such as account creation, logon attempts, and other actions. These events are captured and indexed by Splunk for analysis.

### Observed Outcome: 
- The user NewLocalUser was created, added to the Administrators group, and deleted as expected.
- Corresponding events were captured by Splunk and indexed in the endpoint index.
- Event codes aligned with MITRE ATT&CK T1136.001, demonstrating successful simulation and monitoring of the attack.

# FortiGate config
## üîπ Setup Steps

## Change Splunk Server IP, Originally Splunk was on 192.168.10.60. To match FortiGate‚Äôs network, I changed it to 192.168.100.60.

![Nat_Created](https://github.com/victormbogu1/Windows-Brute-Force-Detection-Monitoring-with-Splunk-Sysmon-and-FortiGate/blob/a17912a36a48903868eff50066db41e724c56239/New%20folder%20(4)/Fortigate%20pinging%20splunk.png)

## Install Fortinet Add-On for Splunk

- Download TA-fortinet_fortigate.
- Extract to /opt/splunk/etc/apps/.
- Restart Splunk.
  
## Install via CLI - Fortinet FortiGate Add-on for Splunk and Extract it:

![Nat_Created](https://github.com/victormbogu1/Windows-Brute-Force-Detection-Monitoring-with-Splunk-Sysmon-and-FortiGate/blob/4030babe196167315aedc4024fecbbead56c4ca0/New%20folder%20(3)/Extract%20fortigate.png)

- Couldn't find it in my app directory so I'd to cd /opt/splunk/etc/apps/ and copy extracted Fortinet Add-On folder into this directory - sudo cp -r ~/Downloads/TA-fortinet_fortigate /opt/splunk/etc/apps/

## Restart Splunk:

![Nat_Created](https://github.com/victormbogu1/Windows-Brute-Force-Detection-Monitoring-with-Splunk-Sysmon-and-FortiGate/blob/4030babe196167315aedc4024fecbbead56c4ca0/New%20folder%20(3)/Copy%20to%20splunk%20app.png)

## ‚ÄúAfter downloading the FortiGate add-on, I configured the syslog server and ensured that syslog forwarding was enabled.‚Äù
config log syslogd setting
set status enable
set server 192.168.100.60
set mode udp
set port 514
set facility local7
set source-ip 192.168.100.160
end
**(Screenshot Missing)**

## Also did the configuration in the fortigate web interface 

![Nat_Created](https://github.com/victormbogu1/Windows-Brute-Force-Detection-Monitoring-with-Splunk-Sysmon-and-FortiGate/blob/8100ef16e67c1acd4af128d0b34e078f2c6f26ef/New%20folder%20(4)/configuring%20syslog%20on%20fortigate.png)

## Verified that the FortiGate add-on is properly installed and appearing in Splunk, ensuring that logs from the FortiGate device are being collected and processed correctly:

![Nat_Created](https://github.com/victormbogu1/Windows-Brute-Force-Detection-Monitoring-with-Splunk-Sysmon-and-FortiGate/blob/e88c710edcb2a30cd86d7a37a3821bff3a40df40/New%20folder%20(3)/Confirm%20Fortigate%20add%20on%20isinstalled.png)

## Enable logging for different events For example, enable logging for traffic, security, and VPN events:

config log setting
set fwpolicy-implicit-log enable
set local-in-allow enable
end

## Enable traffic logging for the policy so web filter events are generated and forwarded to Splunk.

config firewall policy
edit 2
set logtraffic all
next
edit 1
set logtraffic all
next
end

## Notes:
- set logtraffic all logs all traffic matched by this policy, including web filter blocks.

## With syslog logging configured on the FortiGate, log messages will be forwarded to Splunk for monitoring and analysis, provided that UDP port 514 is open and reachable between the FortiGate and the Splunk server.

## Next, I configured Splunk to ingest FortiGate logs via UDP port 514. This involved creating or editing the inputs.conf file within the Fortinet Add-On, followed by restarting Splunk to apply the changes:

- Verified if firewall policy is been configured or applied
- Testpc-firewall ‚Üí policy ID 2
- LAN-to-WAN ‚Üí policy ID 1

## After configuring log ingestion, Splunk successfully displays all FortiGate logs, with Web Filtering events included, allowing for complete monitoring and analysis of network activity:

## Verified that the FortiGate device is successfully integrated and its logs are being collected in Splunk, confirming proper connectivity and log ingestion:

## Splunk successfully displays the Test Machine‚Äôs IP address along with the FortiGate logs, confirming that log events are correctly associated with the source devices for monitoring and analysis:

## To confirm log forwarding, a test event was generated on the FortiGate device. Splunk was then checked to ensure the event was successfully received and indexed, verifying proper log ingestion from FortiGate:

## The FortiGate Web Filtering feature is operational, successfully blocking access to unauthorized or unwanted web applications, as confirmed by the logs displayed in Splunk:

## A table was generated in Splunk to visualize the effectiveness of FortiGate Web Filtering. It shows logs of blocked web applications, including Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, with Instagram having the highest number of blocks. This demonstrates how Web Filtering enforces access control and is effectively captured in Splunk for monitoring:

# üü£ Results & Conclusion
## üîπ What I Accomplished

- Built a full SOC lab:
- AD DC + Target Workstation + Kali Attacker + FortiGate Firewall + Splunk Server.
- Configured Splunk UF + Sysmon for endpoint telemetry.
- Simulated brute-force attacks with Hydra.
- Detected and visualized failed and successful logons.
- Simulated adversary techniques with Atomic Red Team (MITRE ATT&CK).
- Integrated FortiGate firewall logs for network visibility.
- Created Splunk dashboards + alerts for security monitoring.

## üéØ Key Learnings

- SIEM setup (Splunk Enterprise + UF).
- Correlating endpoint + firewall logs.
- MITRE ATT&CK-based detections (Atomic Red Team).
- Hands-on attacker simulation with Hydra.
- Hyper-V VM management + troubleshooting (disk expansion, networking).

## üöÄ Next Steps

- Add DNS, FTP, Proxy logs.
- Expand detections to persistence & lateral movement.
- Automate responses with SOAR.
- Map detections more deeply to MITRE ATT&CK.

## üèÅ Conclusion

- This lab gave me real SOC analyst experience:
- Building a detection pipeline from endpoint ‚Üí SIEM ‚Üí analyst.
- Simulating real-world attacks.
- Investigating events with Splunk queries, dashboards, and alerts.

## üëâ This repo is both a reference guide for me and a tutorial for others who want to learn SOC operations in a home lab.
