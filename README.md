# SOC Homelab ‚Äî AD, Splunk, Sysmon, Kali & FortiGate (Full Implementation)
## Project Overview

Build a compact, reproducible Security Operations lab for detection of Windows authentication attacks (brute force/password-spray) and endpoint activity using Splunk.
This project demonstrates a real-world SIEM implementation using Splunk Enterprise, Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, and FortiGate firewall logs.
What you‚Äôll learn: Active Directory basics, Splunk ingestion and searches, Sysmon configuration, forwarding logs from Windows to Splunk, network log ingestion (FortiGate), attack simulation with Kali, building dashboards & alerts, troubleshooting.


The result: a hands-on lab showing how to detect and investigate brute-force attacks end-to-end.

## üöÄ Architecture
### Components

- üñ• Attacker Machine (Kali Linux) ‚Üí generates brute-force attempts.

- üî• FortiGate Firewall ‚Üí filters traffic & forwards logs to Splunk.

- üè∞ Active Directory Domain Controller (WIN-DC01) ‚Üí authentication service, logs security events (4624/4625).

- üíª Target Windows Machine (Workstation) ‚Üí endpoint under attack, running Sysmon.

- üìä Splunk Enterprise Server ‚Üí central log collector, dashboards, and alerting.

## Data Flow

- Attacker ‚Üí Target (brute-force traffic)

- Target + DC + Standalone_PC‚Üí Splunk (Windows Event Logs + Sysmon)

- Firewall ‚Üí Splunk (syslog logs)

- Splunk ‚Üí Security Analyst (dashboards + alerts)

## Objective & high-level design ‚Äî (What & Why)

- What: I built a small lab: Windows Server 2022 as Active Directory Domain Controller (ADDC), a Windows 10 target workstation joined to the domain, Kali Linux as an attacker, Splunk Enterprise on Ubuntu as the SIEM and Windows Universal Forwarder (UF) + Sysmon on Windows to provide telemetry. FortiGate sends network logs to Splunk for correlation.

- Why: This replicates a small enterprise environment to:

- Generate attacker telemetry (failed logins, successes, suspicious process execution).

- Capture high-resolution endpoint events (Sysmon) and security events (Windows Security logs).

- Visualize and alert in Splunk, practice triage and response.

- Learn correlation of endpoint + network logs (Splunk + FortiGate).

# Hyper-V & networking notes

I used a single NAT/bridged vSwitch (LabNAT) so VMs can talk to each other and the internet. If you want isolation, use multiple vSwitches with routing rules.

Snapshots / Checkpoints: Always create a checkpoint before major changes. Before expanding a VHDX you must delete/merge checkpoints or Hyper-V will not allow editing the disk.

Dynamic disks: When creating VMs, choose dynamically expanding VHDX to save host space. You can expand later via Hyper-V Manager ‚Üí Edit Disk ‚Üí Expand, then extend LVM inside the Linux VM if needed.

Enhanced session mode (host) allows clipboard / file transfer for Windows guests.

Splunk Enterprise on Ubuntu (Detailed)
What & Why

Splunk acts as the central collector & analytics engine. We install Splunk Enterprise and open listening for forwarders (port 9997 default).

Install steps (concise)

Upload .deb to your Ubuntu Splunk VM (or wget from Splunk site).

Install:
